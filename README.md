## Sawatch Labs: Tustin Front End Technical Challenge

Using React I wrote a series of components which displays the fetched api information.  By leveraging state I created the
ability to sort the data by column header.  Clicking the caret-down button toggles the sort direction between ascending and 
descending order.
